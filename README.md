## Muto Discord Bot
---

This project was an introductory application to familiarize myself more with C#. 

Using C#, I leveraged the [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) API and deployed a bot to a server of at least 50 users. This chat bot introduced quality of life features and quick links.

The project first started off as a C# project, but was rewritten in Python as I got more familiar with the Discord API.
